      "content": "Anysphere, the maker of AI coding assistant Cursor, has raised $900 million at a $9.9 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported. The round was led by returning investor Thrive Capital, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Accel, and DST Global.\nThe massive round is Anysphere’s third fundraise in less than a year. The 3-year-old startup secured its previous capital haul of $100 million at a pre-money valuation of $2.5 billion late last year, as TechCrunch was first to report.\nAI coding assistants, often referred to as “vibe coders,” have emerged as one of AI’s most popular applications, with Cursor leading the category. Anysphere’s annualized revenue (ARR) has been doubling approximately every two months, a person familiar with the company told TechCrunch. The company has surpassed $500 million in ARR, sources told Bloomberg, a 60% increase from the $300 million we reported in mid-April.\nCursor offers developers tiered pricing. After a two-week free trial, the company converts users into paying customers, who can opt for either a $20 Pro offering or a $40 monthly business subscription.\nUntil recently, the majority of the company’s revenue came from individual user subscriptions, Bloomberg reported. However, Anysphere is now offering enterprise licenses, allowing companies to purchase the application for their teams at a higher price point.\nEarlier this year, the company was approached by OpenAI and other potential buyers, but Anysphere turned down those offers. The ChatGPT maker bought Windsurf, another fast-growing AI assistant, reportedly for $3 billion.",

      "content": "Perplexity received 780 million queries in May, CEO Aravind Srinivas shared onstage at Bloomberg’s Tech Summit on Thursday. Srinivas said that the AI search engine is seeing more than 20% growth month-over-month.\n“Give it a year, we’ll be doing, like, a billion queries a week if we can sustain this growth rate,” Srinivas said. “And that’s pretty impressive because the first day in 2022, we did 3,000 queries, just one single day. So from there to doing 30 million queries a day now, it’s been phenomenal growth.”\nSrinivas went on to note that the same growth trajectory is possible, especially with the new Comet browser that it’s working on.\n“If people are in the browser, it’s infinite retention,” he said. “Everything in the search bar, everything on the new tab page, everything you’re doing on the sidecar, any of the pages you’re in, these are all going to be extra queries per active user, as well as seeking new users who just are tired of legacy browsers, like Chrome. I think that’s going to be the way to grow over the coming year.”\nSrinivas said the reason Perplexity is developing Comet is to shift the role of AI from simply providing answers to actually completing actions on your behalf. He explained that when you get an AI-powered answer, it’s essentially four or five searches in one. On the other hand, AI performing an action would be getting an entire browsing session done with one prompt.\n“You really need to actually have a browser and hybridize the compute on the client and the server side in the most seamless way possible,” he said. “And that calls for rethinking the whole browser.”\nHe went on to explain that Perplexity isn’t thinking of Comet as “yet another browser,” but as a “cognitive operating system.”\n“It’ll be there for you every time, anytime, for work or life, as a system on the side, or like, just going and doing browsing sessions for you,” Srinivas said. “And I think that’ll fundamentally make us rethink how we even think about the internet.
