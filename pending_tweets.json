      "content": "Anysphere, the maker of AI coding assistant Cursor, has raised $900 million at a $9.9 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported. The round was led by returning investor Thrive Capital, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Accel, and DST Global.\nThe massive round is Anysphere’s third fundraise in less than a year. The 3-year-old startup secured its previous capital haul of $100 million at a pre-money valuation of $2.5 billion late last year, as TechCrunch was first to report.\nAI coding assistants, often referred to as “vibe coders,” have emerged as one of AI’s most popular applications, with Cursor leading the category. Anysphere’s annualized revenue (ARR) has been doubling approximately every two months, a person familiar with the company told TechCrunch. The company has surpassed $500 million in ARR, sources told Bloomberg, a 60% increase from the $300 million we reported in mid-April.\nCursor offers developers tiered pricing. After a two-week free trial, the company converts users into paying customers, who can opt for either a $20 Pro offering or a $40 monthly business subscription.\nUntil recently, the majority of the company’s revenue came from individual user subscriptions, Bloomberg reported. However, Anysphere is now offering enterprise licenses, allowing companies to purchase the application for their teams at a higher price point.\nEarlier this year, the company was approached by OpenAI and other potential buyers, but Anysphere turned down those offers. The ChatGPT maker bought Windsurf, another fast-growing AI assistant, reportedly for $3 billion.",

      "content": "Perplexity received 780 million queries in May, CEO Aravind Srinivas shared onstage at Bloomberg’s Tech Summit on Thursday. Srinivas said that the AI search engine is seeing more than 20% growth month-over-month.\n“Give it a year, we’ll be doing, like, a billion queries a week if we can sustain this growth rate,” Srinivas said. “And that’s pretty impressive because the first day in 2022, we did 3,000 queries, just one single day. So from there to doing 30 million queries a day now, it’s been phenomenal growth.”\nSrinivas went on to note that the same growth trajectory is possible, especially with the new Comet browser that it’s working on.\n“If people are in the browser, it’s infinite retention,” he said. “Everything in the search bar, everything on the new tab page, everything you’re doing on the sidecar, any of the pages you’re in, these are all going to be extra queries per active user, as well as seeking new users who just are tired of legacy browsers, like Chrome. I think that’s going to be the way to grow over the coming year.”\nSrinivas said the reason Perplexity is developing Comet is to shift the role of AI from simply providing answers to actually completing actions on your behalf. He explained that when you get an AI-powered answer, it’s essentially four or five searches in one. On the other hand, AI performing an action would be getting an entire browsing session done with one prompt.\n“You really need to actually have a browser and hybridize the compute on the client and the server side in the most seamless way possible,” he said. “And that calls for rethinking the whole browser.”\nHe went on to explain that Perplexity isn’t thinking of Comet as “yet another browser,” but as a “cognitive operating system.”\n“It’ll be there for you every time, anytime, for work or life, as a system on the side, or like, just going and doing browsing sessions for you,” Srinivas said. “And I think that’ll fundamentally make us rethink how we even think about the internet.

      "content": "Anthropic co-founder and Chief Science Officer Jared Kaplan said his company cut Windsurf’s direct access to Anthropic’s Claude AI models largely because of rumors and reports that OpenAI, its largest competitor, is acquiring the AI coding assistant.\n“We really are just trying to enable our customers who are going to sustainably be working with us in the future,” said Kaplan during an onstage interview Thursday with TechCrunch at TC Sessions: AI 2025.\n“I think it would be odd for us to be selling Claude to OpenAI,” Kaplan said.\nThe comment comes just a few weeks after Bloomberg reported that OpenAI was acquiring Windsurf for $3 billion. Earlier this week, Windsurf said that Anthropic cut its direct access to Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3.7 Sonnet, two of the more popular AI models for coding, forcing the startup to find third-party computing providers on relatively short notice. Windsurf said it was disappointed in Anthropic’s decision and that it might cause short-term instability for users trying to access Claude via Windsurf.\nWindsurf declined to comment on Kaplan’s remarks, and an OpenAI spokesperson did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request. The companies have not confirmed the acquisition rumors.\nPart of the reason Anthropic cut Windsurf’s access to Claude, according to Kaplan, is because the company is quite computing-constrained today. Anthropic would like to reserve its computing for what Kaplan characterized as “lasting partnerships.”\nHowever, Kaplan said the company hopes to greatly increase the availability of models it can offer users and developers in the coming months. He added that Anthropic has just started to unlock capacity on a new computing cluster from its partner, Amazon, which he says is “really big and continues to scale.”\nAs Anthropic pulls away from Windsurf, Kaplan said he’s collaborating with other customers building AI coding tools, such as Cursor — a company Kaplan said Anthropic expects to work with for a long time.

      "content": "Anthropic says it has released a new set of AI models tailored for U.S. national security customers.\nThe new models, a custom set of “Claude Gov” models, were “built based on direct feedback from our government customers to address real-world operational needs,” writes Anthropic in the blog post. Compared to Anthropic’s consumer- and enterprise-focused models, the new custom Claude Gov models were designed to be applied to government operations like strategic planning, operational support, and intelligence analysis.\n“[These] models are already deployed by agencies at the highest level of U.S. national security, and access to these models is limited to those who operate in such classified environments,” writes Anthropic in its post. “[They] underwent the same rigorous safety testing as all of our Claude models.”\nAnthropic has increasingly engaged U.S. government customers as it looks for dependable new sources of revenue. In November, the company teamed up with Palantir and AWS, the cloud computing division of Anthropic’s major partner and investor, Amazon, to sell Anthropic’s AI to defense customers.\nAnthropic says its new custom Claude Gov models better handle classified material, “refuse less” when engaging with classified information, and have a greater understanding of documents within intelligence and defense contexts. The models also have “enhanced proficiency” in languages and dialects critical to national security operations, Anthropic says, as well as “improved understanding and interpretation of complex cybersecurity data for intelligence analysis.”\nAnthropic isn’t the only top AI lab going after defense contracts.\nOpenAI is seeking to establish a closer relationship with the U.S. Defense Department, and Meta recently revealed that it’s making its Llama models available to defense partners.

      "content": "Angelo Sotira started the online digital art platform DeviantArt when he was just a teenager, growing a formative community for millions of artists in the 2000s. Twenty-five years later, Sotira wants to change digital art again, but with a focus on the way it’s displayed.\nOn Thursday, Sotira revealed his new venture, Layer, a screen specifically designed to showcase digital art in the best quality possible.\n“The way that the canvas needs to perform and behave in your life is quite different than other types of displays,” Sotira told TechCrunch. “It needs to blend into beautiful environments.”\nThe closest point of reference that the average consumer would have for a product like this is Samsung’s The Frame TV, which looks like a painting hung on the wall when it’s not turned on. But Layer takes that kind of feel to an even more premium level — unlike The Frame, Layer is not a consumer product, and it’s not trying to emulate static paintings or photographs.\n“They’re $22,000, so that kind of tells you a lot about who that’s for,” Sotira said. “We spared no expense and we spared no effort. We made no compromise in producing what is actually, in our opinion, the very best way to display digital art on a wall.”\nWhen Sotira talks about digital art, he isn’t talking about digital photography or videos.\nLayer is working with hundreds of artists like Casey Reas, who makes generative art — no, not the kind of generative AI art like you’d get from ChatGPT, which is created with LLMs that use other artists’ work without their consent. Instead, many of these artists are writing their own software to create digital artworks that change over time according to what the code says.\nBut these artworks can require a lot of computing power to execute. That’s part of why Layer is so pricey — it needs the technological capacity to display these new kinds of works.\n“You’re looking at an over 35-year history of extraordinary artists developing the medium of code-based art and essentially, th",

      "content": "When Monik Pamecha co-founded AI voice startup Toma in early 2024, he hadn’t anticipated spending the summer months sweating in Bible Belt car dealerships. He and co-founder Anthony Krivonos were still focused on banking and healthcare customers when the dealers came knocking.\n“They just called us up and said ‘we are drowning in phone calls,’” Pamecha described that initial contact in an interview with TechCrunch.\nSeeing an opportunity to pivot into a far less-regulated space than banking or healthcare, Pamecha and Krivonos set up a test: They decided to have their voice agent call essentially every car dealership in the country multiple times. Over the span of a few weeks they found those calls were only picked up 45% of the time.\nThe co-founders packed their bags. And like some sort of modern reinterpretation of the movie “Tommy Boy,” they set out to tour a dozen car dealerships in Oklahoma and Mississippi to get a better understanding of how these businesses work. They got their hands dirty both figuratively and literally; Pamecha said his wife was surprised by the grease stains on his clothes when he returned home.\nThat commitment paid off. Not only did they win customers, they got the dealers’ full charm offensive. The founders shared home-cooked meals — a sometimes awkward-but-funny affair given Pamecha’s vegetarianism, he said — and were invited to tour the Corvette Museum. At least one dealer even asked the Toma founders to tag along to a shooting range.\nSeema Amble, a partner at a16z who led the $17 million that Toma has raised to date, said the pair were “effectively living at these dealerships, going to these dealers’ family barbecues, really understanding how they operate.”\n“We invest in a lot of the next-generation of vertical AI companies, a lot of the best founders have just lived and breathed with these customers to understand what’s going on under the hood,” she told TechCrunch. “No pun intended.”\nThe insights from that trip helped Pamecha and Krivo",

      "content": "Collibra, a data governance platform based in Brussels, is the latest enterprise to acquire a data company in order to expand its offerings in the age of AI.\nOn Thursday, Collibra announced its acquisition of Raito, a data access startup founded in 2021. Raito, also located in Brussels, helps companies manage which employees and customers have access to internal data.\nCollibra declined to comment on the terms of the deal. Raito previously raised $4 million in venture funding from investors, including Dawn Capital, Crane Venture Partners, and Collibra itself.\nCollibra founder and CEO Felix Van de Maele told TechCrunch that while managing data access is not a new problem for enterprises, it is becoming a bigger headache for data teams as more departments seek access for AI agents and workflow automation.\n“We heard from our customers and large organizations that managing data access at scale has become a really big problem,” Van de Maele said. “That’s why the traditional approaches just don’t scale anymore.
